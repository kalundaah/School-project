Health is a major sector in the republic of Kenya. The sector handles building and maintaining of hospitals, licensing of private owned clinics and pharmacies, management of health professionals etc. Hospitals in one way or another need to be interconnected. In the recent past, these interconnections are realized only through the use of telecommunication (phones). The handling of health practitioners has been very mechanical. Select people are entrusted in weighing the need of a health practitioner in certain areas. On a daily basis, there is an increase in cases concerning health. These cases are recorded manually (in books and if advanced, in computers) in most parts of the country. This data is very vital for the continuity of the health sector. They can explain the state of a patient and help in the solution of another case with a different patient. Medicine is an important in giving any solutions to patients. However, these medicines are not tracked in their usage. For the management of the doctors, tracking down the availability of the professionals is done through the heads of the institution. There is a very big need to digitize all this data.
