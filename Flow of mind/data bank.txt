Hospitals in one way or another need to be interconnected. in the recent past, this interconnections were only through the use of telecommunication (phones). But this causes delays especially when the patients life is at stake.

Problem statement.
From the government of Kenya, there was a need to:
•	Have a digital storage of patient, nurse and doctor data.
•	Manage the staff organization in hospitals.
•	Keep stock of medicine.
•	Check for availability of spaces in hospitals.
•	Store solutions of patient treatment.
•	Register new born babies with unique identifications.
•	Biometric checkups and vaccinations.

Health is a major sector in the republic of Kenya. On a daily basis, there is a daily increase in cases concerning health. These cases are recorded in local pharmacies, clinics and hospitals. This data is very vital for the continuity of the health sector. They can explain the state of a patient and help in the solution of another case with a different patient. For the doctors, there was a need for digital management of the human resources (the doctors, nurses etc.) and the medicines.  This brought a need to digitize the handling of all that that data.
