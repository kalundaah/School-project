 A medicine tracking system that engages the patient doctor and the regional director of health on issues surrounding medicine distribution, dose administration, medicine allocation etc. Distribution ensures that medicine is equitably widespread between hospitals (director of health). Administration ensures that the patient takes his or her doses (doctor). Allocation ensures that the patient is able to get his/her medicine from any near clinic/hospital/pharmacy.
 The system entails other features as well.
